          &#x2022;&nbsp;Then we’ll use the same skills we’ve learned to make a banner.<br><br>
          
          &#x2022;&nbsp;After that we’re going to discover ourselves in just one sentence. Making a bio which is interesting to read and attracts people.<br><br>

      <!-- Profile Picture -->

      <button class="accordion"><p class="Name" id="Medium">Profile Picture</p><div class="arrow"><img src="arrow.png"></div></button>
      <div class="panel">
  
        <p>Your profile is your <span class="boldo">face</span> on social media.<br><br>

          People will only remember you from the profile picture they see, that’s why it is the most important detail out of them all.<br><br>
          
          If your pfp is looking good - <span class="italico">a high quality, legitimate photo of yourself</span> - people will instantly think of you that way, they’ll be attracted by it.<br><br>
          
          However most of you have a <span class="italico">shitty</span>, trash quality photo of themselves or even just a random stupid picture, which instead of attracting people, makes them loose interest in you instantly.<br><br>
          
          If you hide yourself from others, how to get a trustworthy following then?</p>

          <img src="Images/Psychology/Profile Picture.png" width="100%" height="auto" style="margin-top: 10px; border-radius: 0.2em;" id="photo">

          <p>Almost all of the profile pictures are trash, because nobody knows how to take a good picture of themselves (<span class="italico">we’ll cover how to do it in action section, step by step</span>) and so to stand out is really not that complicated.<br><br>

            Many people implement design over or behind their face, to make it look different, but that’s not the case though.<br><br>
            
            Profile picture often gives emotion. Yes, even that little circle of your face can shine with all of it’s glory and be recognised in an instant if it stands out - <span class="italico">if it is professional/different</span>.<br><br>
            
            And the thing about being authentic is that each of us are special in our own way, the thing we need to do to stand out - <span class="italico">is to show who we really are to others</span>.</p>

            <blockquote class="notion-quote">
              <p class="weak">Your profile picture is your FACE on social media. Make it look so good that people could recognise it in a millisecond!</p>

      <!-- Banner -->

      <button class="accordion"><p class="Name" id="Medium">Banner</p><div class="arrow"><img src="arrow.png"></div></button>
      <div class="panel">
  
        <p>But what about the <span class="boldo">header</span>? or how you call it “<span class="italico">banner</span>”?<br><br>

          Well, it’s just as important as your pfp.<br><br>
          
          It’s the <span class="boldo">background</span> of your profile picture.<br><br>
          
          It’s the back story everything that you’re doing.<br><br>
          
          Yes, It matters a lot too, and you can either make it increase your overall appearance or ruin it.<br><br>
          
          People don’t care as much about it, as your pfp and bio, but it should match the emotion that you’re trying to share.<br><br>
          
          Header is like a big advertisement of your body and personality.<br><br>
          
          People should be attracted by it just like to ads, on social media, who are trying to catch your attention.</p>

          <img src="Images/Psychology/Banner.png" width="100%" height="auto" style="margin-top: 10px; border-radius: 0.2em;" id="photo">

          <p>Mostly headers represent important visual information too.<br><br>

            You can see a lot of people put a little arrow next to the follow button, to guide you to press it, and sometimes it works.<br><br>
            
            Imagine a header like a background behind you, imagine it as the <span class="boldo">landing page</span> (<span class="italico">that’s why I call it header</span>).<br><br>
            
            When people see a well designed banner, they instantly sense the professionalism behind your brand.<br><br>
            
            Make it be worth it.</p>

            <blockquote class="notion-quote">
              <p class="weak">Header/Banner is a background of your profile. It either makes it look more appealing or break everything apart. It’s the last piece in the appearance puzzle. It should be the landing page of your profile.</p>
            </blockquote>
  
      </div>

      <!-- Bio -->

      <button class="accordion"><p class="Name" id="Medium">Bio</p><div class="arrow"><img src="arrow.png"></div></button>
      <div class="panel">
  
        <p>Another aspect of your profile is your bio.<br><br>

          Bio literally means biography, and no, not that old boring book about some random guy with all of his actions and memories, it’s about you.<br><br>
          
          When people catch an eye on your profile picture the next thing they will do is check your bio.<br><br>
          
          And if they see a lot of random text, sentences, emojis, symbols, overall just a mess without any structure, they will <span class="boldo">IN AN INSTANT</span> close your profile and never ever come back.<br><br>
          
          That’s how most of you probably share your story with others.<br><br>
          
          No wonder why you look so boring, <span class="italico">even though you are an amazing person in real life</span>.</p>

          <img src="Images/Psychology/Bio.png" width="100%" height="auto" style="margin-top: 10px; border-radius: 0.2em;" id="photo">

          <p>You have to be able to share what you are in a short paragraph, you have to seem <span class="boldo">professional</span> and authentic so that your future clients would have fun reading about you, and for sure, would like to know you more.<br><br>

            While reading it, your brain unconsciously starts to make an imagination of you in real life, they predetermine how you live, act, work, just from reading a couple of lines.<br><br>
            
            By reading a short paragraph we should be able to imagine an exact copy of oneself.<br><br>
            
            When people meet you the first time - <span class="italico">they check your bio</span>.<br><br>
            
            After reading just 2-3 sentences about you, they should know everything.</p>

            <blockquote class="notion-quote">
              <p class="weak">Bio - biography of yourself. Make it enjoyable to read. It forms an imagination of you in your client’s mind. This can either make them like you, or never want to see you again.</p>

            <div class="divider" style="height: 1px; background-color: white; width: 100%;"></div>

            <p>It might get boring at this point to learn about psychology, you can ask yourself “<span class="italico">Why the hell do I have to learn about stupid psychology, why does it matter?</span>”, well it’s the bare bones, the logic behind if you’re going to succeed or not. <br><br>

              I’m telling you this not only to give an understanding on how your mind works, but also to be able to manipulate others with your own skills, which we will cover latter.<br><br>
              
              We have got a <span class="boldo">pfp</span>, <span class="boldo">bio</span>, <span class="boldo">header</span>, what else could there possibly be more to uncover?<br><br>
              
              Well, if you want to make people like you more than anyone they know, you’ve got to invest in your posts, <span class="boldo">graphic</span> <span class="boldo">design</span> and finally a <span class="boldo">website</span>.<br><br>
              
              So let’s continue:</p>
  
      </div>

      <div class="panel">
  
        <p>Yes, your writing style matters too.<br><br>

          It can either lead people into reading everything you got to offer, or just make them skim through it and move on without understanding what you’ve meant.<br><br>
          
          The way you write the text - <span class="italico">is your voice</span>.<br><br>
          
          When there is a lot of shit mixed together into one big “<span class="italico">cow’s pancake</span>” (<span class="italico">even bigger shit</span>), no one wants to even read it.<br><br>
          
          Ofcourse, your true followers don’t even care about the structure of how you write, they care about what you’re trying to share, but that’s the minority of people.<br><br>
          
          We all want to read a well spaced, pointed out, clear text, so that it would be easy and beautiful to read.</p>

          <img src="Images/Psychology/Posts.png" width="100%" height="auto" style="margin-top: 10px; border-radius: 0.2em;" id="photo">

          <p>Text is the way to share your emotions.<br><br>

            While reading, a person should be taken into another dimension of your story, that you’re trying to tell, they should be super interested and attracted by it so that they’d do anything you tell them too.<br><br>
            
            Make your unique, authentic self shine throughout the words that you’ve written and everyone won’t have a problem talking back to you too.</p>

            <blockquote class="notion-quote">

        <p>People probably found you by seeing one of your posts.<br><br>

          Was that luck or you attracted them because of your content?<br><br>
          
          Well, people get attracted way easier if they see a stunning and high quality, custom made graphic design, made specific for that post.<br><br>
          
          It just gets into your consumers brains that you are the one - <span class="italico">you’re that good one</span>, and they want to get back and back to see your posts with amazing art to be entertained.<br><br>
          
          The thing with this is, that you don’t only make your followers get back to you, but also attract way more new eyes than you expected.</p>

          <img src="Images/Psychology/Graphic Design.png" width="100%" height="auto" style="margin-top: 10px; border-radius: 0.2em;" id="photo">

          <p>When you scroll, what you see is text.<br><br>

            You don’t expect to see a stunning design, and when you do, you definitely stop to read it, and give feedback.<br><br>
            
            That’s the magic of being different.<br><br>
            
            Well you got to be thinking now that you “<span class="italico">don’t even know how to do graphic design</span>”, don’t worry, I will teach you latter in this course!</p>

            <blockquote class="notion-quote">
              <p class="weak">Post with graphic design gets way more eyes than regular text, because no one knows how to make design. Be the one who knows how to do it at the end of this course.</p>

      <div class="panel">
  
        <p>The last thing I want to uncover is the psychology behind websites.<br><br>

          To have your own custom website defeats everything I’ve said earlier. <br><br>
          
          When people see that you’ve got a fucking website they get out of their minds.<br><br>
          
          Why do people do that?<br><br>
          
          It’s because no one knows how to make a websites themselves, they do know that they cost a lot to make though.<br><br>
          
          When they do see a person who knows how to do it or has done it, no matter the pfp, bio or header, the person <span class="boldo">instantly</span> believes that you’re professional.<br><br>
          
          If you can do it, you’re “golden”.</p>

          <img src="Images/Psychology/Website Development.png" width="100%" height="auto" style="margin-top: 10px; border-radius: 0.2em;" id="photo">

          <p>Website is where you sell yourself, it’s your evidence of existence.<br><br>

            When people open it, they should be greeted with professionalism and clarity.<br><br>
            
            Yes, the web should be well built too, not like you see, almost everyone uses free softwares to make an “<span class="italico">ok</span>” page.<br><br>
            
            It works, but is not effective at all, that’s why to have a <span class="boldo">professional</span> website is a must.<br><br>
            
            It’s an instant win of being better than all the competition.</p>

            <blockquote class="notion-quote">
              <p class="weak">Personal website defeats it all and makes you look professional, without even people seeing your pfp or bio. It’s your proof of existence. Sell yourself there, attract others, make them buy from you and think that you’re 10x better than them.</p>

        <!-- Theory -->
  
        <button class="accordion"><p class="Name" id="Normal">Theory</p><div class="arrow"><img src="arrow.png"></div></button>
        <div class="panel">

          <p>I’m an enthusiastic, professional photographer with over <span class="boldo">3 years of experience</span> (<span class="italico">see my photos</span> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/augustas_armalis/" class="lita" target="_blank">here</a>).<br><br>

            Doing it all because it’s one of my many passions which I enjoy doing everyday.<br><br>
            
            Don’t worry if you don’t know anything about photography, I’ll make sure to give you a strong foundation of the things you need to do in order to become one!<br><br>
            
            Let’s start from learning:</p>

          <br>
    
          <!-- Composition -->
  
          <button class="accordion"><p class="Name" id="Light">Composition</p><div class="arrow"><img src="arrow.png"></div></button>
          <div class="panel">
    
            <p>It is super important to learn composition in order to take a competent photo, and I’ll tell you everything about it within <span class="boldo">6 pin points</span>.<br><br>

              Now go to your phone or camera settings and enable what’s called “<span class="italico">grid</span>”.<br><br>
              
              It will show 4 intersecting lines on your screen which will help us. <br><br>
              
              Then go outside and lets learn and at the same time practise!<br><br>
              
              <span class="boldo">1. Follow the Rule of Thirds</span><br><br>
              
              The “rule of thirds” is a composition technique that is super easy to learn and just as easy to apply to your images to help you create better photos.<br><br>
              
              When it comes to capturing photos, many people simply point the camera at their subject and press the shutter button.<br><br>
              
              Job done! By following the rule of thirds, however, you can create a stronger, more interesting photo which, undeniably, makes your photo look professional.<br><br>
              
              Now, when you have got your “<span class="italico">grid</span>” enabled, simply compose your shot so your main focal points (<span class="italico">things you want to shoot</span>) are positioned on, or close to, one of the four intersecting lines.<br><br>
              
              If that’s not possible, then position your subject along one of the lines or in the middle of the window.</p>

              <img src="Images/Action/Profile Picture/Grid 1.png" width="100%" height="auto" style="margin-top: 10px; border-radius: 0.2em;" id="photo">

              <p>Any photo that you take, in which the main subject is placed just there, where the lines cross, will make your photo look professional.<br><br>

                Here are a few examples of <span class="boldo">MY</span> photos that follow the <span class="italico">rule of thirds</span> used in photography:</p>

              <img src="Images/Action/Profile Picture/Grid 2.png" width="100%" height="auto" style="margin-top: 10px; border-radius: 0.2em;" id="photo">

              <img src="Images/Action/Profile Picture/Grid 3.png" width="100%" height="auto" style="margin-top: 10px; border-radius: 0.2em;" id="photo">

              <p><span class="boldo">1.1 Breaking the Rule of Thirds</span><br><br>

                There are times, of course, when rules are meant to be broken – <span class="italico">for example, when you want to fill your frame with your subject, which is often the case with portraits, pets, or when you want to photograph a landscape or subject with a lot of symmetry</span>.</p>

              <img src="Images/Action/Profile Picture/Grid 4.png" width="100%" height="auto" style="margin-top: 10px; border-radius: 0.2em;" id="photo">

              <img src="Images/Action/Profile Picture/Grid 5.png" width="100%" height="auto" style="margin-top: 10px; border-radius: 0.2em;" id="photo">

              <p><span class="boldo">2. Include Texture</span><br><br>

                Add interest and detail to your portrait photography by including texture in your images.<br><br>
                
                Position your subject against a background which has a contrasting texture.<br><br>
                
                For example, rough tree, wall, any object which can form a beautiful view just behind you (<span class="italico">don’t worry about it too much, because we’re going to use something called “bokeh” to make it blurred</span>)</p>

              <img src="Images/Action/Profile Picture/Texture.png" width="100%" height="auto" style="margin-top: 10px; border-radius: 0.2em;" id="photo">

              <p><span class="boldo">3. Create a Shallow Depth of Field</span><br><br>

                You probably have seen that “<span class="italico">professional</span>” looking background blur, it’s called “<span class="italico">bokeh</span>” and unfortunately it’s achieved only on a camera, because it has a setting called aperture, which determines how much light goes into the camera.<br><br>
                
                The more light, the bigger “<span class="italico">bokeh</span>” blur behind you.</p>

              <img src="Images/Action/Profile Picture/Aperture.png" width="100%" height="auto" style="margin-top: 10px; border-radius: 0.2em;" id="photo">

              <p>This is the thing that mobile phones cannot naturally do, only with a help with <span class="italico">AI</span> you can make it on your smartphone, but it doesn’t seem real.<br><br>

                By seeing the blur behind you, everyone will instantly associate the taken photo with <span class="boldo">professionalism</span>, because bokeh makes the image <span class="boldo">POP</span>!</p>

              <img src="Images/Action/Profile Picture/Bokeh.png" width="100%" height="auto" style="margin-top: 10px; border-radius: 0.2em;" id="photo">

              <p><span class="boldo">4. Provide Direction</span><br><br>

                When positioning your subject A.K.A. - <span class="italico">yourself, consider the direction of your body and eyes</span>.<br><br>
                
                Compose your photo so you have space to look at to, not directly to the camera - <span class="italico">don’t be a creep</span>.<br><br>
                
                You might say to me now that you don’t know how to pose?<br><br>
                
                I’ll tell you a secret - <span class="italico">the way that you’re reading this right now is your natural form</span> (<span class="italico">fix your back to be straight</span>).<br><br>
                
                Try to be yourself and don’t overthink it.<br><br>
                
                Just stand, legs shoulder width and improvise, be yourself!</p>

                <img src="Images/Action/Profile Picture/Direction.png" width="100%" height="auto" style="margin-top: 10px; border-radius: 0.2em;" id="photo">

                <p><span class="boldo">5. Use Leading Lines</span><br><br>

                  This minor detail can truly enhance your photo.<br><br>
                  
                  By finding lines which lead the way of the frame, like a road or pillars like in example, and when you frame your camera, look that the place where it ends in the horizon is in the middle of the frame (<span class="italico">or try to put yourself just at the point where it ends/leads</span>).<br><br>
                  
                  The point is, that this makes the whole world around you, lead towards you and so makes your photo look well placed.</p>
                
                  <img src="Images/Action/Profile Picture/Leading Lines.png" width="100%" height="auto" style="margin-top: 10px; border-radius: 0.2em;" id="photo">

                  <p><span class="boldo">6. Break the rules</span><br><br>

                    Considering all of what I’ve said to you, break all the rules you can.<br><br>
                    
                    It’s you, who is controlling everything, so be creative and find your way into positioning the camera - <span class="italico">the way that think is the best for you</span>.<br><br>
                    
                    Shoot for the moon.</p>

                    <img src="Images/Action/Profile Picture/Moon.png" width="100%" height="auto" style="margin-top: 10px; border-radius: 0.2em;" id="photo">

                  <div class="divider" style="height: 1px; background-color: white; width: 100%;"></div>

                  <p>You surely did not expected to see a whole tutorial on how to be a <span class="italico">photographer</span>, did you?<br><br>

                    Well, I’m just starting, lets continue with the:</p>

                    <br>
          </div>

          <!-- Place -->

          <button class="accordion"><p class="Name" id="Light">Place</p><div class="arrow"><img src="arrow.png"></div></button>
          <div class="panel">
    
            <p>Now, since you’re a professional photographer, better than anyone you know (<span class="italico">except me xD</span>) we can continue on finding a place to make this photo.<br><br>

              It can be a special place, it can be everywhere you’d like it to be, what matters is that you got light shining at your beautiful face.<br><br>
              
              No, home is not a place for that, go outside, touch some grass.<br><br>
              
              Me personally, I love the mornings and evenings, when the sun becomes orange, when the “<span class="italico">golden hour</span>” happens, it’s truly something special.<br><br>
              
              The place could mean something to you, or it can be totally random.<br><br>
              
              The point is to make this photo special for you, then it will be special to others.</p>

            <img src="Images/Action/Profile Picture/Efiel.png" width="100%" height="auto" style="margin-top: 10px; border-radius: 0.2em;" id="photo">

            <p>Now, put this course down and just go outside, take a walk with your camera, shoot some photos and learn, apply all the rules I’ve told you, experiment.<br><br>

              When you’re done learning how to capture photos, it’s time to capture yourself.<br><br>
              
              Let’s do it together and edit the photo too!</p>
    
          </div>

        <div class="panel">

          <p>You are a professional photographer now, you can take a photo of yourself.<br><br>
            
            <span class="boldo">Right</span>?<br><br>

            Then, get groomed, dress nicely, invite a friend over or a tripod to take a picture for you.<br><br>
            
            Come to the place you’ve choose and just take a <span class="italico">fucking</span> picture.<br><br>
            
            Don’t go like “<span class="italico">I’m not pretty today, I look stupid!</span>”, <span class="boldo">yes</span>, you will look horrible if you constantly think like that.<br><br>
            
            Just make all of that noise gone.<br><br>
            
            <span class="boldo">Quiet</span>.<br><br>
            
            Then stand in the middle of your camera, in the middle of the leading lines, in the middle of the background and take a picture.<br><br>
            
            Take many pictures, try to place your camera there, or over there, and just have fun! (<span class="italico">set the shutter timer on your camera, or if you’re alone</span> (<span class="italico">which you shouldn’t be</span>), <span class="italico">text me, I’ll come to help</span>).<br><br>
            
            Most importantly don’t overcomplicate this thing.<br><br>
            
            Enjoy the time you’re spending on doing something new and fun!</p>

            <p>Then grab that white arrow on the right and drag it to the left, to the start of the big mountain.<br><br>

              Do the same adjustment, and look how you image becomes brighter, how it shines with it’s glory.<br><br>
              
              Be aware again of <span class="boldo">not</span> making it <span class="boldo">too bright</span> too.<br><br>
              
              But again, make it as bright as you want, “<span class="italico">break the rules</span>”.</p>

            <p>There are mainly 2 types of pfps.<br><br>

              One of them is no background, just one color or texture, maybe even everything in grayscale.<br><br>
              
              That’s what all of the mediokers are doing to stand out, well it does not work as good as a true photo.<br><br>
              
              It’s too dull and boring to look at, it doesn’t <span class="boldo">STAND OUT</span>.<br><br>
              
              That’s the reason why I don’t recommend you to do that, but if you feel that it’s wrong, go ahead and do what looks the best to you!</p>

              Let’s move on!</p>
    
        </div>

        <br><br>

      </div>

      <!-- Bio -->

      <button class="accordion"><p class="Name" id="Medium">Bio</p><div class="arrow"><img src="arrow.png"></div></button>
      <div class="panel">

        <p>It’s a story, about who you are and your future goals, about what you are and for who it is.<br><br>

          This short paragraph is the second thing, that people look at after getting hooked by your pfp, that’s why it has to be <span class="italico">professional</span> too.<br><br>
          
          You have the freedom to write the bio however you want, but probably, you can’t write it so it fits into that stupid word limit.<br><br>
          
          Let me help you to make it fit perfectly!</p>

        <br><br>

        <!-- Theory -->
  
        <button class="accordion"><p class="Name" id="Normal">Theory</p><div class="arrow"><img src="arrow.png"></div></button>
        <div class="panel">
    
          <p>As well as with photography, you need theory to write a good bio too, you need writing skills to make it look and sound appealing.<br><br>

            So let’s start with these <span class="boldo">4 points</span>:<br><br>
            
            <span class="boldo">1. Don’t Be Overly Formal</span><br><br>
            
            It’s a common mistake for people, like you, to be overly formal in their bio.<br><br>
            
            By trying to fit a big message or summary into that tiny space, your brand can become overly edited and appear very uptight rather than fun and approachable.<br><br>
            
            Make sure your bio is easy to read, is appealing to your audience, and has potential to attract new followers.</p>
            
          <img src="Images/Action/Bio/Formal.png" width="100%" height="auto" style="margin-top: 10px; border-radius: 0.2em;" id="photo">  

          <p><span class="boldo">2. Allow Your Brand Voice to Shine</span><br><br>

            You have likely spent quite a bit of time creating a unique appearance and voice that speaks to your brand’s mission and the tone that you want to use while communicating with audience.<br><br>
            
            Your bio is a great place to allow that voice to i as you try to attract new visitors and inform your current followers.<br><br>
            
            Try to make the bio your “<span class="italico">voice</span>”.</p>

          <img src="Images/Action/Bio/Mic.png" width="100%" height="auto" style="margin-top: 10px; border-radius: 0.2em;" id="photo"> 

          <p><span class="boldo">3. Share the Most Important Information</span><br><br>

            While you want to keep your bio light and concise, you also need to communicate key information.<br><br>
            
            Take some time to go through the different messages you want to share.<br><br>
            
            Write them down, or even create a whole big text about yourself.<br><br>
            
            Pick what is the most important for your brand to share, cut it out and try to make one sentence.<br><br>
            
            Hopefully to seduce potential new followers into checking you out more!</p>

          <img src="Images/Action/Bio/Lcok.png" width="100%" height="auto" style="margin-top: 10px; border-radius: 0.2em;" id="photo">

          <p><span class="boldo">4. Have Fun with Your Bio</span><br><br>

            Bio is a short paragraph about your whole life.<br><br>
            
            Have fun researching your old memories, values and putting them into one place.<br><br>
            
            If your bio seems to lack your abilities, then go get some or share your future goals as a part of the story.</p>

          <img src="Images/Action/Bio/Friends.png" width="100%" height="auto" style="margin-top: 10px; border-radius: 0.2em;" id="photo">

          <p>The thing about your bio is the same as with photography rules:<br><br>

            "<span class="italico">You have to break them in order to get what you want</span>"<br><br>
            
            So don’t be afraid to do so.<br><br>
            
            Now, open that notes file and let’s write a professional bio together!</p>
    
        </div>

        <!-- Action -->
  
        <button class="accordion"><p class="Name" id="Normal">Action</p><div class="arrow"><img src="arrow.png"></div></button>
        <div class="panel">

          <p>Now I need you to take your whole life and put it in a sentence.<br><br>

            I believe it’s impossible to put everything, so don’t.<br><br>
            
            Choose only 2-3 fundamental things to put about you.<br><br>
            
            Those things should be the ones you’re pursuing or using in order to run your brand.<br><br>
            
            For example, I can play piano, I’m a videographer, I can cook, I love Paris, and all of those things <span class="boldo">does not matter</span>!<br><br>
            
            What matters is 1 or 2 things that I’d like to share with this world (<span class="italico">like me for example, in my bio I share only these skills that I’m trying to teach you</span>), to attract similar people, to pursue only on that 1 thing. <br><br>
            
            Why?<br><br>
            
            Because you can only be “<span class="italico">good</span>” at everything, but you can be “<span class="italico">professional</span>” only in <span class="boldo">one</span> aspect of your life.<br><br>
            
            Choose what it is.<br><br>
            
            Pursue it.</p>

            <img src="Images/Action/Bio/Augis 1.png" width="100%" height="auto" style="margin-top: 10px; border-radius: 0.2em;" id="photo">

            <p>The next thing you need to know is your <span class="italico">future goals</span>.<br><br>

              What is the thing you’re trying to achieve by doing the things you do?<br><br>
              
              For example: “<span class="italico">retire my parents, become financially independent, have 1k followers at the end of this month</span>”, people like to see that you’ve got a vision up ahead of your life, that you’re constantly on it, and believe in yourself that you can achieve it.<br><br>
              
              Define 1-2 main goals to share and that’s enough.<br><br>
              
              Like I say: “<span class="italico">Less is more</span>”.<br><br>
              
              The more specific you become with yourself the better the outcome you achieve.<br><br>
              
              My dream is to drive a motorcycle, but it’s not relevant to others at all, so I don’t share it.</p>
            
            <img src="added/Moc.png" width="100%" height="auto" style="margin-top: 10px; border-radius: 0.2em;" id="photo">

            <p>Another thing you can add is your “<span class="italico">mission</span>”.<br><br>

              What you’re doing here, what are you helping?<br><br>
              
              Ex: “<span class="italico">Helping you grow your biz, helping you get fit etc</span>”.<br><br>
              
              People will know that you use those skills not only to benefit yourself, but to help the people around you, and by defining what you help you need to know for who you help.<br><br>
              
              What type of person you’re doing all of this for?<br><br>
              
              For pregnant woman? For young entrepreneurs?<br><br>
              
              You have to be specific, and just don’t be like: “<span class="italico">helping everyone…</span>”, you mean you even help my dog to do that? Wow.<br><br>
              
              Just define 1 or 2 groups of people which you want to connect with.<br><br>
              
              Remember “<span class="italico">more is less</span>”, that quote works the other way around too.</p>

            <img src="Images/Action/Bio/Augis 2.png" width="100%" height="auto" style="margin-top: 10px; border-radius: 0.2em;" id="photo">

            <p>So now, think.<br><br>

              What are you in just one sentence?<br><br>
              
              What I could read about you and in an instant understand what you’re all about.<br><br>
              
              Like me for example "<span class="intalico">I’m a young, hard working teenager, who is pursuing his dreams every day</span>".<br><br>
              
              That’s what it should be.<br><br>
              
              Go, write, journal all of your life on the sheet of paper.<br><br>
              
              Imagine that you’re writing this for another person to fully understand <span class="boldo">EVERYTHING</span> about you.<br><br>
              
              Then after you do it, underline the key points, your hobbies, passions.<br><br>
              
              After that put all of those main points into one place and start connecting one with each other.<br><br>
              
              After these first 1-2 sentences are done, share your goals, your missions, your dreams that you’re working towards.<br><br>
              
              Take me - <span class="intalico">I’m helping people to improve their appearance on social media, also I have a goal of reaching $10k/month</span>. (<span class="intalico">not enough space to fit that info xD, have not done it yet...</span>)</p>

              Most importantly - <span class="boldo">DON’T USE EMOJIS</span>, you’ll look fucking stupid and childish, no one will take you seriously.<br><br>
              
              That’s why you’ve got to use “white space” (the space between text) or symbols to divide the ideas like dividers “ | ”, dots “ ⚬ ” and so on…<br><br>
              
              Just don’t make it overkilled with random symbols everywhere. <br><br>

            Good job if you followed around and actually learned something from this.<br><br>
            
            This will surely make your profile look well though of and almost professional.<br><br>

            Well, because we’re not done yet.<br><br>
            
            In order to become truly professional you have to implement these 3 more things left: <span class="italico">graphic design</span>, <span class="italico">header</span> and a <span class="italico">website</span>.<br><br>
            
            Those are the main components that makes you stand out from your competition - <span class="italico">this means being professional</span>.<br><br>
            
            Yes, I know you don’t have any idea on how to make graphic design or code a website.<br><br>
            
            I do.<br><br>

        <p>This is a high value skill, and I’m going to share to you how to get started on learning and implementing it!<br><br>

          Yet still, no one knows how and where to do it.<br><br>
          
          When somebody sees some sort of visuals they will check it out first, and forget about others.<br><br>
          
          That’s why you have to have graphic design all over your posts.<br><br>
          
          You might not be an artist, and that’s okay, you’re authentic within yourself and even if what you draw looks stupid, to others it’s you, it’s beautiful.<br><br>
          
          You probably seen many designs, but never knew where the fuck they’re able to make them.<br><br>
          
          What software, where, <span class="boldo">HOW</span>?<br><br>
          
          There are many softwares, but the best in my opinion is “<span class="italic">Figma</span>”, like <span class="italic">sigma</span>.<br><br>
          
          Let’s learn how to become <span class="italic">sigma</span> ourselves and learn <span class="italic">Figma</span>!</p>

          <p>Sit near your computer again, overall it’s your workplace where you make money, where you improve these days.<br><br>

            So Figma is a cloud based software, which basically means that you can open this tool in a browser near any computer.<br><br>
            
            But at your main work station, <span class="italico">download</span> the app.<br><br>
            
            The link is <a href="https://www.figma.com/downloads/" class="lita" target="_blank">here</a>.<br><br>
            
            After you install it, download <span class="italico">font installer</span> too (<span class="italico">to be able to use custom fonts</span>).<br><br>
            
            Create a new account and let’s get started, because this is going to be a software, which you will use to make your designs <span class="boldo">POP</span>.</p>

          <p>This is a fairly easy software to use, there are many great tutorials out there, and I share the best one - <span class="italico">the one I’ve started my journey with</span> right <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZuk6Wkx_Eg&t=2s&ab_channel=FluxAcademy" class="lita" target="_blank">here</a>.<br><br>

            Learn how to use Figma <span class="boldo">FREELY</span>, so you won’t need any tutorials.<br><br>

            After watching the video I’ve provided <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZuk6Wkx_Eg&t=2s&ab_channel=FluxAcademy" class="lita" target="_blank">here</a>, shut everything, and make random stupid designs in order to get the controls, and be able to create absolutely anything.<br><br>
            
            If you know what you want to make, but don’t know how, of course go check out new tutorials, but after watching it, create like 10 more projects in which you use what you’ve learned on your own.<br><br>
            
            Just build this skill as much as you can, because you’ll be able to use it not only to grow your brand by making visuals, but in every aspect of your life

          <p>I’ve been learning sigma for over 3 years now, and as you can see the visuals and this website are stunning.<br><br>

            I have learned it as best as I can in order to be better than my competition.<br><br>
            
            Use it to your benefit and thank me latter.<br><br>
            
            We’re almost done!<br><br>
            
            Since you’re now are a <span class="italico">professional photographer</span>, <span class="italico">writer</span> and <span class="italico">graphic designer</span>, the two more things you need is a banner and website.<br><br>
            
            Let’s explore it together after learning how to work with Figma ourselves.
            
            Yes, it will be a project for you to create, let’s learn more about it!</p>

          <div class="divider" style="height: 1px; background-color: white; width: 100%;"></div>

          <p>If you suck or have no time to do design yourself, I can offer you myself.<br><br>

            I can make custom graphic designs for your profile, in any style you desire.<br><br>

            <span class="italico">Thankyou</span>.<br><br>
            
            Let’s continue to the exercise then!</p>
    
        </div>

        <br><br>
  
      </div>

      <!-- Banner -->

      <button class="accordion"><p class="Name" id="Medium">Banner</p><div class="arrow"><img src="arrow.png"></div></button>
      <div class="panel">

        <p>If you have not read the full pfp guide in the first place - <span class="italico">go and do it</span> - because you’ll need the same knowledge here, as there.<br><br>

          So the banner is a backstory of your profile picture.<br><br>
          
          The best thing it could be, is a picture, taken in the same place as the profile picture.<br><br>
          
          Walk around and take as many pictures as you like of the background of your portrait pic.<br><br>
          
          Implement and break all the photography rules.<br><br>
          
          Then edit in Gimp the same way as you did, and voila!<br><br>
          
          There is another way to make a banner, and it can be graphic design.<br><br>
          
          Mostly with a quote inside, maybe some texture and effects, visuals, but not overkill, because it has to match the feeling and emotion that your face represents.<br><br>
          
          Don’t overthink the banner, let it be the thing you want it to be.</p>

          <img src="Images/Psychology/Banner.png" width="100%" height="auto" style="margin-top: 10px; border-radius: 0.2em;" id="photo">

          <p>Put one picture, then after some time you’ll not like it anymore.<br><br>

            Change it, and look how the other one looks.<br><br>
            
            This process of trying different pfps and banners is totally normal, I have done it, and you should too in order to find that “<span class="italico">professional</span>” look that we’re all craving for.<br><br>
            
            Like in life, time goes, time changes, so are you changing too, don’t be afraid to express the change to the world.<br><br>
            
            If you leave the same profile for years everyone will think that you just put it there and forgot about it.<br><br>
            
            Yes, you have after doing it, just forget about it and let it run on it’s own.<br><br>
            
            Of course don’t change it everyday, because people will not be able to remember your face that easily.<br><br>
            
            But don’t forget to renew everything time to time.<br><br>
            
            Rebrand when your life changes.<br><br>
            
            Show to the world how you advance.<br><br>
            
            Believe me, everyone will notice it.</p>

        <div class="panel">
    
          <p>Like I’ve said, that your banner is an advertisement of yourself, the extended story of your personality and values.<br><br>

            Figure out what is your mission, as we will already done it in the bio section<br><br>
            
            And bring that idea to life with design or photography. (if you don’t know how to do create stunning graphic design, go the fuck up and do it!).<br><br>
            
            Make the header look just as attractive as your profile picture<br><br>
            
            Make them share the same design and feeling.<br><br>
            
            That’s why I’ve said to take the picture at the same place as the pfp, or connect these photos with same style and visuals.</p>

          <p>We’re almost done becoming professionals ourselves, so stay with me, because now we’re going to uncover the <span class="boldo">hardest</span> and most <span class="boldo">valuable</span> aspect out of everything - <span class="italico">websites</span>.<br><br>

            Let’s explore!</p>
    
        </div>

        <br><br>
  
      </div>
      
      <!-- Website -->

      <button class="accordion"><p class="Name" id="Medium">Website</p><div class="arrow"><img src="arrow.png"></div></button>
      <div class="panel">

        <p>This singe thing can make you from an average person on social media to a <span class="italico">professional</span> human being.<br><br>

          It’s so valuable, that learning how to do it yourself or hiring somebody to do it (<span class="italico">me :D</span>) is worth every penny.<br><br>
          
          Now a bit more about it:</p>
  
        <br><br>

        <!-- About -->

        <button class="accordion"><p class="Name" id="Normal">About</p><div class="arrow"><img src="arrow.png"></div></button>
        <div class="panel">
    
          <p>It takes a hell of a lot of time to master.<br><br>

            To learn how to code, do everything yourself is the most complicated thing of them all.<br><br>
            
            It has bring me the recognition, because of how high value skill it is.<br><br>
            
            Why?<br><br>
            
            Because nobody knows how to do it.<br><br>
            
            Now you might say to me that there are many “<span class="italico">no code</span>” softwares which help you, by making a “<span class="italico">no code</span>” website.<br><br>
            
            Yes, but you’ll have to pay a lot of money to keep it running and have those “<span class="italico">extra</span>” features which you probably don’t know how works.<br><br>
            
            You also can say that AI can make a website for you, yes it can, but the website is trash and if you want to change it, you have no skills or understanding what to do (<span class="italico">also everyone will notice the AI work and won’t even think about you being professional</span>).</p>

          <img src="Images/Psychology/Website Development.png" width="100%" height="auto" style="margin-top: 10px; border-radius: 0.2em;" id="photo">

          <p>The website’s build quality is what matters too.<br><br>

            If you’ve got a poorly built and structured website, it will not look legit, won’t bring many eyes nor sales to you.<br><br>
            
            It’s the same thing as with “<span class="italico">professionalism</span>” psychology of your profile.<br><br>
            
            If it looks clean, amazing, well built and most importantly high quality, without a doubt you’ll become the best of the best.<br><br>
            
            If you have money, you probably have payed someone to make the website for you or you’re still wasting money on the “shopify” or “hostinger” subscriptions…(<span class="italico">also wasting time learning those no code tools, because you know it </span>“<span class="italico">good enough</span>”<span class="italico"> and it’s bad</span>).<br><br>
            
            There is no solution to this problem.<br><br>
            
            Either you learn it by yourself (<span class="italico">it will take you years, like it took for me to master it</span>) or pay someone to do it for you<br><br>
            
            Just to show you, here’s the code behind this section.<br><br>
            
            This entire website took me <span class="boldo">1 month</span> with over than <span class="boldo">5 000 lines of code</span> to make.</p>

          <img src="added/Code.png" width="100%" height="auto" style="margin-top: 10px; border-radius: 0.2em;" id="photo">

          <p>Now, don’t be sad if you’re learning a no code software and making a very tiny websites on your own, it’s <span class="boldo">super great</span>!<br><br>

            Continue on learning in order to create a website so good, that people can’t live without it.<br><br>
            
            That’s the level you need to achieve if you’re on this path of being a web-developer<br><br>
            
            Be aware, that website development is a <span class="boldo">huuuge</span> topic, with so many stuff that can take years to master, so do your research, and decide if to pursue this thing further, or no.<br><br>
            
            Also websites often are the sign of “<span class="italico">wealth</span>”, because if you have your own fully custom website, you instantly become the best out of everyone who you know.<br><br>
            
            It’s a minor yet most efficient way to make your brand look and be professional, to bring you most success and recognition.<br><br>
            
            The problem that most of us lack - <span class="italico">money</span>.<br><br>
            
            And typically website developers asks for tens of thousands, because of the incredibly large impact that it can do to your brand.</p>

        <p>After you learn all of those skills which I’ve provided for you.<br><br>

          Maybe not all of them were suitable for you, and that’s totally okay.<br><br>
          
          Maybe you’ve hated some of them like I hate singing (<span class="italico">it’s the thing I hate the most in my life</span>), but I hope you’ve got interested in at least one of them.</p>

          <p id="subbtext">Look at yourself, what have you learned?<br><br>

            What have you knew and implemented to make it even better?<br><br>
            
            Did you even like to take action and build your skillset?<br><br>
            
            I know you did, and you might be asking what to do next?<br><br>
            
            Well, I say follow your heart.<br><br>
            
            Follow your passion and deep purpose.<br><br>
            
            And if you want another answer - just continue doing the things you do everyday.<br><br>
            
            I didn’t know what to do with these skills until now - I share them with you.<br><br>
            
            I know that there are not a lot of individuals like you and me who are actually interested in living the life they want.<br><br>
            
            That’s why I believe in you that you’ll take my value from this course and hopefully apply it to the future.<br><br>
            
            Thankyou.</p>
    
        </div>

        <p>Continue your journey of learning and pursuing them.<br><br>

          Give effort into it every single day.<br><br>
          
          Grind until you succeed.<br><br>
          
          Most importantly be happy with what you do, because you have only one, short life.<br><br>
          
          Get the most of it by enjoying what you do.<br><br>
          
          Some of these skills can even make you financially independent (<span class="italico">like web-dev or design</span>), can grow your brand, and bank account!<br><br>
          
          The thing I’ve understood while being only <span class="boldo">15 years old</span>, is that everything is learnable.<br><br>
          
          I did learn all of these skills to be irrespective from other people, and to avoid paying a lot of money latter (<span class="italico">that’s what you’ve got to do when you grow up</span>).<br><br>
          
          Yes, I’ve “<span class="italico">wasted</span>” my childhood learning, but I loved every fucking second of it.<br><br>
          
          And I hope you are going to love it too.<br><br>
          
          Find new skills, maybe you can implement them with what you’ve learned here and make even better outcome.<br><br>
          
          That’s great!</p>

          <p>The most important rule is to "<span class="italico">break the rule itself</span>".<br><br>

            If you don’t agree with me, feel free to do whatever your purpose tells you to.<br><br>
            
            You are the writer of your life, you’re the designer and the developer of your dream life.<br><br>
            
            Make those goals a reality, exactly how you want it to be.<br><br>
            
            I believe in you, and you should believe in yourself too.</p>

          <div class="divider" style="height: 1px; background-color: white; width: 100%;"></div>

          <p>With that said, what to do next?<br><br>

            Is to <span class="boldo">learn</span> and never stop learning.<br><br>
            
            Life is all about learning from your mistakes and never doing them again - <span class="italico">this way advancing in life</span>.<br><br>
            
            It’s about pursuing your purpose and doing whatever you like and want!<br><br>
            
            Yet most people these days forgot that they can do all of this - <span class="italico">that they can live their dream life now</span>.<br><br>
            
            And I wish you the same.</p>
